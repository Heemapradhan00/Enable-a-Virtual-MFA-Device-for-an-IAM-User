# Enable a Virtual MFA Device for an IAM User  

## Introduction  
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your GitHub account. By enabling 2FA, you ensure that both your password and a one-time code generated by an authenticator app are required to sign in.  

## Steps to Enable 2FA on GitHub  

1. **Sign in to your GitHub account.**  

2. Go to your **Profile Picture** in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.  

3. In the left sidebar, click **Account Security**.  

4. Under **Two-Factor Authentication**, click **Enable two-factor authentication**.  

5. Select **Set up using an app** to configure a virtual MFA device.  

6. Open an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy, or Duo Mobile):  
   - Scan the QR code displayed on GitHub  
   - OR manually enter the secret key provided.  

7. Your app will start generating one-time codes.  

8. Enter the two consecutive codes from the app in the fields provided on GitHub to verify.  

9. Download **recovery codes** and save them securely. These codes are crucial to regaining access if you lose your authenticator app.  

10. Click **Enable** to complete the setup.  

## Important Notes  

- Keep your **recovery codes** in a safe and secure place.  
- Consider setting up a backup authenticator app for redundancy.  
- If you lose access to both your authenticator app and recovery codes, you will need to contact GitHub support for assistance.  

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your GitHub account and protect it from unauthorized access.
